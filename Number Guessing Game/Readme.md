**Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯**



A simple Python console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

This project is beginner-friendly and uses only:



Variables



Loops



Conditionals



**ðŸ“Œ How to Play**



The computer generates a random number between 1 and 10.



You have 5 attempts to guess the correct number.



After each guess, the program will tell you:



"Too low!" if your guess is smaller than the number.



"Too high!" if your guess is bigger than the number.



"Correct!" if you guessed it right. ðŸŽ‰



If you use all attempts without guessing correctly, the game ends and reveals the number.



**ðŸ›  Technologies Used**



Python 3



Built-in random module (for number generation)



Basic Python concepts:



Variables
